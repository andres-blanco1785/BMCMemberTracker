After commiting changes to your test branch and merge into your main branch. After the merge, Heroku will automatic deployment will occur for the staging app. Open the staging app when it's done building, move the app into production to have the changes. You have now officially deployed your app! ![Screen Shot 2021-10-04 at 5 25 14 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53985591/135932952-32d54ebe-735e-40a2-97bb-192d2c6baa9c.png)


## CI/CD ##

For the CI/CD portion of our development, we set a standard that each team member would commit and push changes to their feature branch as frequent as possible so that we wouldn't have huge merge conflicts later on at the end of the sprint. We also set up Branch Protection Rules in our repository so that the person creating a pull request into the main branch cannot merge/complete their own request. The changes that each team member made would be tested and merged into our test branch, which would deploy and test our changes automatically through GitHub Actions. The deployment process was done through Heroku, which would automatically deploy our test/main environments if the build was successful and integrate any updates that we would make to our application.
